# BEng Project - OpenCV section
The image processing section of my BEng Project in autonomous vehicle movement with sensor fusion and probabilistic methods
Takes Kalman Filter prediction information for where the robot is and uses computer vision algorithms in that Region of Interest (ROI) to efficiently track the robot and provide absolute position readings for the Kalman Filter
